        <h4>Pizza Crust</h4>

            <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>2 envelops FLEISHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups for hot water (120-130 degrees F to be exact)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with a half cup water in a medium sized bowl. Set aside so flavors can set while preparing the crust</li>
            <li>For the crust: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until blended (about a minute). Slowly add the remaining flour until a soft, sticky dough ball can be formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes on a surface covered with flour, until dough is smooth and elastic. If needed add more flour. (If you're using RapidRise Yeast. let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (make sure to have hands covered in flour as well) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan or roll doll to fit inside the pans.</li>
            <li>For pizza: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top the center with sauce, cheese and pepperoni.</li>
            <li>Now bake for 18-20 minutes until crust are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, make sure to rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks half way through baking.</li>
        </ol>
